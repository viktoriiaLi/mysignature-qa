## Risk

Users who authenticate via Google can bypass mandatory onboarding steps.

If required onboarding fields (e.g. Position) are not completed, the user should not gain access to the dashboard.

This may lead to:
- incomplete user profiles
- broken onboarding logic
- inconsistent system state
- incorrect access control
